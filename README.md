# Professional Readme Generator
## Description
We have created a ReadME generator that will allow the user to enter information for each section through node.js and it will then create a complete ReadME file. It will begin by asking for title, description, installation, usage, contribution, test, gitHub username, email, and which license to use. Once completed, it will input the information into a ReadME template.

THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
